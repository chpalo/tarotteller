                    <p>In Pamela Smith's interpretation for the RWS deck, a young man carries a staff (wand) from which a bindle hangs in his right hand. He delicately pinches a white rose between his left thumb and index fingers. Before a yellow sky with full sun overhead, he strides left, towards the edge of a cliff. Water rages behind and below. He gazes up, away from the ledge. He wears a richly patterned tunic over long, white sleeves, tights, and yellow boots. In his hair, he wears a headpiece/laurels and a red feather. A small, white dog dances at his heels.</p>
					<p>For non-RWS decks, alternate descriptions can go in this paragraph.</p>
					<p>The Fool represents almost limitless potential. It is an egg, a body without organs. It is a plunge into the unknown, deep into the unconscious mind or spiritual world. It is an appreciation for beauty and a refusal to hold back any of oneself. It is also a careless but innocent misuse of talents/tools.</p>
					<p>This paragraph is for any personal notes or interpretations of the card. This is not the place for personal musings, but for meanings which have entered head-canon.</p>

					<h2>Rachel Pollack, <i>78 Degrees of Wisdom</i>, 1997</h2>
                    <p>&#x2022; The Fool is "movement, change, the constant leap through life." (17)</p>
                    <p> &#x2022; "Teaches us that life is simply a continuous dance of experience." (17)</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; "Really a separate category all by itself [...] belongs everywhere and anywhere" (21)</p>
                    <p>- "Trickster," "court jester."" (25)</p>

					<h3>As Journey's Beginning</h3>
                    <p>&#x2022; "The leap into the archetypal world of the trumps." (24)</p>
					<p>&#x2022; "0 is not strictly a number at all, rather it represents the absence of any specific number, and therefore we can say that it contains all numbers within itself. It symbolizes infinite potentiality. All things remain possible because no definite form has been taken." (13)
                    <p>&#x2022; "The Fool bears the number 0 because all things are posible to the person who is always ready to go in any direction. He does not belong in any specific place; he is not fixed like the other cards." (16)</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; In Arabic numerals, the number 0 bears the shape of an egg, to indicate that all things emerge from it. Originally the zero was written as a dot; in Hermetic and Kabbalistic tradition the universe emerged from a single point of light. And God in the Kabbalah is often described as 'nothingness' becasue to describe God as any thing would be to limit Him to some finite fixed state. (16)</p>

					<h3>The Fool and The World</h3>
					<p>&#x2022; Along with The World, "They present themselves as fixed states of existence." (13). "The Fool rushes forward richly clothed [...] looks about to leap into the lower world from some high distant country."</p>
					<p>&#x2022; Shows a unity, the Fool being some sort of perfect state before duality, and the World giving us a glimpse of the exhilirating snese of freedom possible if only we can reconcile the opposites buried in our psyches." (14) "The split between potentiality and actuality." (15)</p>
					<p>&#x2022; The Fool and The World, are "psychic hermaphrodites, expressing their complete humanity at all times, by their very natures." (17)
                    <p>&#x2022; "Splits into the Magician and the High Priestess, who must be brought back together again to form The World." (17) 
                    <p>&#x2022; The two cards represent the splitting up of the Fool's innocence into the illusion of oppsites."</p>

					<h3> On Innocence</h3>
                    <p>&#x2022; "The Fool represents true innocence, a kind of perfect state of joy and freedom, a feeling of being one with the spirit of life at all times; in other words, the 'immortal' self we feel became entrapped in the confusions and compromises of the ordinary world. Perhaps such a radiant self never really existed. Somehow we experience our intuition of it as something lost." (16)</p>
					<p>&#x2022; "Innocence [...] does not mean 'without guilt' but rather a freedom and a total openness to life, a complete lack of fear that comes through a total faith in living and in your own instinctive self. Innocence does not mean 'asexual' [...] it is sexuality expressed without fear, without guilt, without connivance and dishonesty. It is sexuality expressed spontaneously and freely, as the expression of love and the ecstasy of life." (16)</p>
                    <p>&#x2022; "His innocence makes him a person with no past, and therefore an infinite future. Every moment is a new starting point. (16)</p>
